# C++ Basic Programs

This repository contains three simple C++ programs demonstrating fundamental programming concepts:
1. **Sum of First N Natural Numbers**
2. **Factorial of a Number**
3. **Reverse a String**

Each program includes user input, processing logic, and output display to help beginners understand basic C++ operations such as loops, recursion, and string manipulation.

## 1️ Program: Sum of First N Natural Numbers
### Theory
The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is calculated by adding all integers from `1` to `n`.  
- **Mathematical Formula:** `Sum = n × (n + 1) / 2`  
- In this program, we use a **for loop** to add numbers sequentially and store the result in a variable `total`.

## 2️ Program: Factorial of a Number
### Theory
The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.  
- **Formula:** `n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) ... × 1`  
- We use **recursion** to compute the factorial:  
  - Base Case: `factorial(0) = 1`  
  - Recursive Case: `factorial(n) = n × factorial(n - 1)`


## 3️ Program: Reverse a String
### Theory
Reversing a string means rearranging the characters so that the first character becomes last and vice versa.  
- We first calculate the length of the string manually by traversing until the null character (`'\0'`).
- Then, using a **for loop**, we swap characters from the start and end moving toward the center.

##  Overall Learning
- **Loops:** Used for summation and string reversal.  
- **Recursion:** Used to calculate factorial.  
- **Input/Output Handling:** Demonstrates `cin`, `cout`, and `cin.getline()` for user interaction.  
- **Logic Building:** Strengthens understanding of basic algorithmic thinking.

##  Conclusion
These three programs demonstrate the fundamental concepts of C++ programming:

- **Loops** are used to perform repetitive tasks such as calculating the sum of numbers and reversing a string.  
- **Recursion** simplifies problems like factorial calculation by breaking them into smaller subproblems.  
- **String Handling** shows how arrays and character manipulation can be applied in real scenarios.  

Through these exercises, a beginner learns essential skills like logic building, input/output handling, and basic algorithm design, forming a strong foundation for more advanced C++ programming.
